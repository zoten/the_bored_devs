> Or: how my feet stepped on the People Path

This blog post is about random opportunities, PTSD, asking ourselves powerful questions and giving wrong answers only. I'd like this to be the first of a series of posts about Engineering Management. Let's see.

Here I am, one year and some months into this new role, trying to get some useful insights to share with anyone with enough patience, time and lack of self-respect to read my rambling chatters.

## Who have I been?

The story of my life will be the topic of another blog post - then hopefully a book and a great movie that will become a classic in some niche -, so for this time we can just state the bare minimum to get some context.

I've been a professional software engineer for 12+ years, after having spent my education through a technical high school and five years of Computer Science at two universities (classic bachelor's + master's degree). That's mostly it.

Of those 12 years, 11 have been spent at the same company. That's a huge amount of time, if you think about how much the field has changed in the last decades. That's partially because the Italian market has been frozen in time since the eighties, but mostly becaause I was working at an Italian startup that was doing fun things, and I had the chance to participate to something that was both an oxymoron (a startup that was surviving in Italy) and on the edge of technology (telecommunications in the 4G at the time / 5G later space).

I say this to highlight two important things for setting this post's context:

 * I have been a hands-on person all the time. Whether leading small teams, being part of tech steering groups, talking with 3rd party vendors or customers, I have consistently been building things. Good? Bad? Whatever.
 * I invested a lot there: economically, sentimentally, morally. I've been a workaholic with my whole heart and ignored opportunities and classical career paths in the name of something that was a mission to me. I've been the loyal soldier and preacher of a higher ideal, building the future against all odds, knowing that the good ones always win at the end.

And then I've been betrayed. That's a story for the future.

### Who was I?

Many words, I hoped I would have been able not to write this semi-rant that my good friends (and my psychologist) already know way too well, but I think it conveys the minimum message necessary to understand who and where I was: a decent software engineer who has identified for way too long with his own job, landing a new position in an unknown field (insurtech) with burnout and a huge PTSD as the only perceived luggage for his travel.

## Finding your why

This title is exactly what I **didn't** do at the time. What *I did* was instead spending my month of vacation between arrears home chores, some sparse rest and frenzy study about things I may have missed they was essential for the job, and if I arrived not knowing them everyone would have known that I was not smart at all and hiring me would have been clearly seen as a mistake and I would surely be left home before my probation period and my whole family - and in particular my 1-year-old son whom future would have been then doomed - would have known I am the worst father and person ever existed. If only modern medicine gave a name to this.

Well, if we let ourselves put the past apart: things went really well. The onboarding at [Prima](https://www.helloprima.com) was smooth, the welcome warm, the culture great. If I look at the notes from my first 1:1 with my former manager the thing that I'm most happy to read sounds like: "we took a lot of decisions together and, even if we had opposite ideas, we smoothly converged to a common solution". Well, to be fully honest I was also happy I to start having real 1:1s, with a real schedule and a great active listener. That was enlightnening to me, but I would have realized it only later.

The job was fun. I confessed it multiple times in multiple circumstances during those years, but I wasn't expecting it. At the time, I just needed a place to extinguish the fire in my head and clean up the poison in my blood. Instead, I spent a year doing things I loved: we were building interesting architectures in fun languages and with new platforms, tackling non trivial problems in a space that was way more complex that I was imagining. I was able to propose improvements, create helpful tools and documentation, publish an open source utility library, give speeches and share knowledge all within a team that was heterogeneous in experiences, respectful, high performing and absolutely a blast to work with.

## Building your why

The more I lived this small but performing reality - small as team, not as company that was indeed way bigger -, the more I understood what was working and what has not worked in the past. Coming from a problem space where I had a lot of domain knowledge to an unexplored one was essential in re-learning how to be wrong, and the pleasure hidden in discovering what was right instead.

> No one enjoys being wrong, but I do enjoy *having been* wrong, because it means I am now less wrong than I was before.
> (Danny Kahneman)

Other than the incredible team, I owe a lot of this to my former Engineering Manager - who was himself an incredibly talented *Individual Contributor* lent to the *People Track* because of team's needs - which had an unmatched empathy and attention to each detail that matters, and made me think *"Hey, maybe I can do more too?"*.

I loved having impact. I loved seeing my work span more than a team, sparking conversations, creating challenges. That's what I wanted to do. That's what I wanted to learn. I have some reasons why this feeling was not exactly the same in the former startup, even if I had more responsibilities and *potentially* even more impact, but again, that's for another story to come.

I started reading. Well, I was already reading a lot, when my child allowed, but I started focusing more on particular technical literature. Good technical literature has a blurred boundary where the purely technical detail starts fading and the bit leaves space to the system where that bit moves both from an architectural and from a social point of view. I was reading about what becoming a Staff Engineer meant at various company sizes, and then concepts started melting with management/people/social ones. I didn't realize it, of course. I still wanted to become a Staff Engineer in the future. I was reading about distributed systems, high performance computing, data mesh, artificial intelligence, metaprogramming. And then I decided to do what I was already doing decently well: talking with people.

## Forgiveness or regrets?

I've never had problem speaking to power at my job. In part because that was possible in my previous experience - with alternate results -, but mostly because I assume no one can read my mind and if I feel something is important it is my duty and one of the ways I have to create value to say things, maybe in different flavours depending on the audience.

So what I could do to kickstart a conversation was asking to people that already had experience in the field, and I had plenty to disturb. In particular, my VP of Engineering was luckily also assigned as a *pro tempore* talent manager, with some focus on learning and growing tech people - hey, that's me!

Why didn't I ask my EM, since I had he uttermost respect for him and his views? Well, we were already having some conversations around growth. In the same timeframe we were performing some serious performance review, assessing competences and levels, and the company's career framework was being shaped. Also, he knew I was reading about the topics. Maybe I needed the point of view of who was already there, maybe I wanted to ask someone who didn't climb the ladder at this company because the target was so long term that in my mind wasn't even possible **at** this company.

### Knowing what you don't know

It was a cozy January evening when I sent my VPE a cold email (yes, we had chats etc., but I was comfortable with that media at the time for something that was a super low priority question for anyone in this world). I was not expecting more than some new literature, some hints/tips, maybe just a "hey, we have learning paths here, take a look". The summary of the request was something like:

> [...] So, my question is somewhat generic but I'd like to ask if you have any good source, being books or courses or words of wisdom or whatever else you could recommend to someone exploring that direction

...and that direction was the Staff+ position, which was two levels over my head at the time. A couple of days later we dropped into the call that changed everything.

Part of it was expected: as we talked about the role of the Staff+ as seen at the company at the time, what we both agreed is that more experience was needed not so much for the technical aspect (which however would have obviously been a non trivial part of the work to get there) but also for the understanding on the overall company's internals that I was missing. I couldn't understand my domain yet, how could I see how the whole beast moved? And I mean not only about **the** company itself, but any corporate big enough to have international investors and regulators. I never had that experience and for how - and when - my mind works I couldn't perform an architectural alignment job if I didn't understand it. Also, the Staff+ roster was complete at the time but hey, mine was a long term plan, remember?

However...

### Knowing what you want to know

Remember my EM? I really meant it when I said he's an exceptional contributor, from both technical and social sides. And he wanted to return to this kind of job. I absolutely don't remember how I reacted when my VPE proposed me to consider the role. I remember him mentioning that my name was already in the list and I probably took some time to think. But not so much, because six days later I was talking about the road to become an Engineering Manager with my EM. A random question about another topic at the right time was unexpectedly pivoting my journey.

### Knowing that you don't know

I was pretty scared. What if they were totally wrong about me, first of all? Did I fake it too much?

*"Your empathy will be helpful in this role"*, said the person whose ability to instantly understand people and situations through the blink of an eye, gathering all my envy. Come on!

What about the role expectations? People management, hands on managers, coaching, being able to lead and influence without authority tech conversations...wasn't this the kind of job I was saying I was unprepared to tackle, **but** with People management duties over it?

Last but not least, I was becoming manager in the team I had worked in for almost a year. A great team that could really do well - probably better - without me (I know, I said *hands on* manager but I already knew the first months at least I wouldn't have been able to do much while learning the ropes. In a future post we'll see it went way worse!), but still a team of people and friends I knew, grew with, worked side by side. Was I becoming the teacher's pet? Was I supposed to change my approach? Could they accept it?

## Finding some whys

*"At least I'm not the manager descended top down that everyone will hate"* I thought. They were probably *already* hating me, and that could be a comfortable known fact to begin with.

I had really bad managers in my life before this experience. Most *top down descended* maangers were really, really bad. I know, this is unprofessional to write, to say, maybe even to think, but sometimes you just have to state the truth. Most were not intentional bad managers and a single one - which was by no mean the worst but something else altogether - once **apologized** to me for having been a "bad" manager.

So, this was the first why: I discovered that my views about management were possible and I was in a place that resonated with them. I lived them. Maybe I couldn't perform at the desired level to make them true, but at least I could try.

That's how this path began.

## Wrap up

This is a story about luck, impostor syndrome, random questions and it has no real moral. The only learning you may extract is probably: ask. Asking, talking, doing valuable things and talking about them with valuable people - not valuable as position in the "ladder" - are things that can move you forward in your path, whatever it is. And sometimes, be ready to change this path, because what we want and what we need may diverge, at least for some time. Get awareness of your starting point and some clarity on your target, and be ready to change your mind on the directions, because the road is fun and bumpy.

Next time, let's talk about the transition. There's a lot of fun and some pain.
