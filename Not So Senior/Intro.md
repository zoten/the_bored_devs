# Intro

_Not So Senior_ is a collection of gotchas and events that happened to [people](https://github.com/zoten) that are supposed to be _senior_ enough not to have this kind of events happen to them, or not to make this kind of mistakes.

Except, they happen.

Let's remember: _junior_, _middle_, _senior_, _staff_, _principal_ ... they are only titles.

We all make mistakes, we all fall in some cyclic misjudgements. We all have impact.
